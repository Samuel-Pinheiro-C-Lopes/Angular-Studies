<p>This is a practice tool created to reinforce the directives @Output and @Input used to 
databind between component with Angular. Data passed in the "char-data" component are used by the "char-component" to create
a sheet for a character.</p>

<app-char-data
    (charCreated) = "onCharCreated($event)"></app-char-data>
<hr />
<div>
    <app-char-component 
        *ngFor="let char of chars"
        [characterData] = "char"    
    ></app-char-component>
</div>
